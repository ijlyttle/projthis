Description: One of the barriers to making projects portable is dependency
  management. The goal of this package to provide a lightweight solution, 
  using the DESCRIPTION file. This is the same mechanism used to manage
  dependencies for packages; it is subject to the same limitation: the project 
  will run using the latest version of all its dependencies. The functionality
  of this package lies somewhere between {usethis} and {renv}, hence the 
  thought to create yet another package.
