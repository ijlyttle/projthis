# These are assembled from snippets of actions built by Jim Hester.
# You will need to customize this template; the r-lib actions repository
# is a great place to start to figure things out: https://github.com/r-lib/actions

# This action is based on the 'pkgdown' action:
# https://github.com/r-lib/actions/blob/master/examples/pkgdown.yaml

# For help debugging build failures open an issue on the RStudio community with the 'github-actions' tag.
# https://community.rstudio.com/new-topic?category=Package%20development&tags=github-actions

# More information at https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions

# I'm adding a lot of comments because you will likely need to adapt this
# to your circumstances. I trust the comments will be helpful; I also trust
# that anyone who sees a mistatement/error will feel welcome to file an issue
