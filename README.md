One of the barriers to making projects portable is dependency
management. The goal of this package to provide a lightweight solution,
using the DESCRIPTION file. This is the same mechanism used to manage
dependencies for packages; it is subject to the same limitation: the
project will run using the latest version of all its dependencies. The
functionality of this package lies somewhere between [usethis]() and
[renv](), hence the thought to create, yet, another package.

## Installation

Nothing really to install, yet - just a shell. For the moment, working
out the API.
