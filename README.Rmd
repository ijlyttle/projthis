Let's say you have project consisting of RMarkdown files that collect and compile data, and you want to generate reports **on a schedule**. This package may be for you.

One of the barriers to making projects portable is dependency management. 

The goal of this package to provide a solution using the DESCRIPTION file. This is the same mechanism used to manage dependencies for packages; it is subject to the same limitation: the project will run using the **latest version of all its dependencies**.
This assumption makes this a lightweight solution; the cost is making sure the project remain current with its dependencies.

This effort sprang from a discussion of a [usethis issue](https://github.com/r-lib/usethis/issues/1194).
This package lies somewhere between [usethis](https://usethis.r-lib.org/) and [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv), hence the thought to create yet another package, at least for now.

## Usage

If you are creating a project from scratch, you can use `proj_create()`: 

  - wraps `usethis::create_project()`
  - also installs a `DESCRIPTION` file to store your dependency declarations

If you have an existing project, and want to add a `DESCRIPTION` file, use `proj_use_description()`:

  - wraps `usethis::use_description()`
  - default behavior is to detect existing package-dependencies in your project, then add them to `Imports`

If your project has a `DESCRIPTION` file, to update dependencies you can use `proj_update_deps()`:

  - uses `renv::dependencies()` to compile the declared and detected package-dependencies
  - to check, but not update the `DESCRIPTION` file, use `proj_check_deps()`

To reproduce the behavior of your project on another computer, you can use `proj_install_deps()`:

  - wraps `remotes::install_deps()` to install all the project dependencies

To run your project using GitHub Actions, you can use `proj_use_github_action()`:

  - wraps `usethis::use_github_action()` to install an Actions template in your project
  - template draws upon [r-lib/actions examples](https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples) to install R, and to install and cache the dependencies
  - **you will need to modify** your project's copy of this template to tell Actions how to build and deploy your project
 
## Installation

You can install the GitHub version of projthis with:

```r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("ijlyttle/projthis")
```

## Acknowledgments

There is precious little original to this package, which is a good thing.
This package rests squarely on the foundation laid by the [**usethis**](https://usethis.r-lib.org/) package, and also relies on [**renv**](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/), [**desc**](https://github.com/r-lib/desc), [**remotes**](https://remotes.r-lib.org/), and [**actions**](https://github.com/r-lib/actions).
