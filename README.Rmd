One of the barriers to making projects portable is dependency management. 
The goal of this package to provide a lightweight solution, using the DESCRIPTION file. This is the same mechanism used to manage dependencies for packages; it is subject to the same limitation: the project will run using the latest version of all its dependencies.
The functionality of this package lies somewhere between [usethis](https://usethis.r-lib.org/) and [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv), hence the thought to create yet another package.

This effort sprang from a discussion of a [usethis issue](https://github.com/r-lib/usethis/issues/1194).

## Usage

- Your project consists of some RMarkdown files that collect and compile data, then generate reports **on a schedule**. You can use GitHub Actions to run all of this automatically.

If you are creating a project from scratch, you can use `proj_create()`, which wraps `usethis::create_project()`. 
It will also install a `DESCRIPTION` file to store your dependency declarations.

If you have an existing project, and want to add a `DESCRIPTION` file, use `proj_use_description()`, which wraps `usethis::use_description()`. 
Its default behavior is to detect the dependencies in your project, then add them to `Imports`.

If your project has a `DESCRIPTION` file, you can use `proj_update_deps()` to update the dependencies, or `proj_check_deps()` to check them (but not update the `DESCRIPTION` file). 
These functions use `renv::dependencies()` to compile the declared and detected package-dependencies.

To reproduce the behavior of your project on another computer, you can use `proj_install_deps()`, which wraps `remotes::install_deps()` to install all the project dependencies.

To run your project using GitHub Actions, you can install an Actions template in your project using `proj_use_github_action()`. 
This draws upon [r-lib/actions examples](https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples) to automate the installation on R and to install and cache the dependencies. 
However, **you will need to modify** your project's copy of this file to tell Actions how to build and deploy your project.
 
## Installation

You can install the GitHub version of projthis with:

```r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("ijlyttle/projthis")
```
## Acknowledgments

There is precious little original to this package (which is a good thing).
This package rests squarely on the foundation laid by the [**usethis** package](https://usethis.r-lib.org/), and also relies on [**renv**](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/), [**desc**](https://github.com/r-lib/desc), [**remotes**](https://remotes.r-lib.org/), and [**actions**](https://github.com/r-lib/actions).
