The projthis package offers a framework for analysis-based project workflows.
You can use it to:

-   manage your project's package-dependencies; projthis helps you use a `DESCRIPTION` file.

-   manage the dependencies among files in your workflows; projthis provides tools to support a directory structure and a naming convention.

-   automate the rendering of your workflow using GitHub Actions; projthis provides a template for an Action.

The [getting-started article](https://ijlyttle.github.io/projthis/articles/projthis.html) provides a bottom-up treatment of what this package does; for a top-down overview, see the [design-philosophy article](https://ijlyttle.github.io/projthis/articles/design-phlosophy.html).

To see the projthis framework in action, here's a [repository that puts it to use](https://github.com/ijlyttle/covidStates).

## Installation

You can install the GitHub version of projthis with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("ijlyttle/projthis")
```

## Acknowledgments

There is precious little original to this package, which is a good thing.
This package rests heavily on the foundation laid by RStudio's [**usethis**](https://usethis.r-lib.org/) package, and also relies on their [**renv**](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/), [**desc**](https://github.com/r-lib/desc), [**remotes**](https://remotes.r-lib.org/), and [**actions**](https://github.com/r-lib/actions) packages.
Of course, the gold-standard for managing dependencies within a workflow is William Landau's [**drake**](https://docs.ropensci.org/drake/), now superseded by [**targets**](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/).

The idea to put some structure on analysis development in R is not new:

-   I learned the term "analysis development" from Hilary Parker, who has published a [pre-print](https://peerj.com/preprints/3210/), and given an [rstudio::conf() presentation](https://rstudio.com/resources/rstudioconf-2017/opinionated-analysis-development/) on the topic.

-   Jenny Bryan has long been an advocate for more-humane organization of R workflows.
    Perhaps her most famous "hot take" is included in this [blog post](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2017/12/workflow-vs-script/), which has served as a foundation for this work.

-   Sharla Gelfand has discussed her implementation in a [blog post](https://sharla.party/post/usethis-for-reporting/) and an [rstudio::conf() presentation](https://rstudio.com/resources/rstudioconf-2020/don-t-repeat-yourself-talk-to-yourself-repeated-reporting-in-the-r-universe/).

-   As well, Emily Reiderer discussed her approach in a [blog post](https://emilyriederer.netlify.app/post/rmarkdown-driven-development/) and an [rstudio::conf() presentation](https://rstudio.com/resources/rstudioconf-2020/rmarkdown-driven-development/).

-   Steph Locke and MaÃ«lle Salmon offer the [**starters**](https://itsalocke.com/starters/) package, to help you set up R projects for a variety of use cases.
