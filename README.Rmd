The goal of projthis to provide a lightweight package-dependency management framework for R projects, by using the `DESCRIPTION` file. 

This is the same mechanism used to manage dependencies for packages; it is subject to the same limitation: the project will run using the **latest version of all its dependencies**.
This assumption permits a lightweight solution; the cost is to ensure the project remains current with its dependencies.

This effort sprang from a discussion of a [usethis issue](https://github.com/r-lib/usethis/issues/1194).
This package lies somewhere between [usethis](https://usethis.r-lib.org/) and [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv), hence the thought to create yet another package, at least for now.

## Demo

You can see this package in action at this [projthis-demo](https://github.com/ijlyttle/projthis-demo#projthis-demonstration) repository, which aims to be a minimum reproducible example of this package's functionality. It includes:

- a `README.Rmd` file, in which is calculated the top-downloaded packages, over the last day, that contain a randomly-chosen letter.
- a `DESCRIPTION` file which contains a declaration of all the package dependencies.
- a [GitHub Actions file](https://github.com/ijlyttle/projthis-demo/blob/master/.github/workflows/project-run.yaml) which instructs Actions to render `README.Rmd`:
  - upon change, and
  - every day at midnight UTC
  
The README also details the steps taken to build the project.  

## Usage

There are not a lot of functions in this package.

`proj_create()`, to create a project from scratch: 

  - wraps `usethis::create_project()`
  - also installs a `DESCRIPTION` file to store your dependency declarations

`proj_use_description()`, to add a `DESCRIPTION` file to an existing project:

  - wraps `usethis::use_description()`
  - default behavior is to detect existing package-dependencies in your project, then add them to `Imports`

`proj_update_deps()`, to update the package-dependency declaration in the `DESCRIPTION` file:

  - uses `renv::dependencies()` to compile the declared and detected package-dependencies
  - to check, but not update the `DESCRIPTION` file, use `proj_check_deps()`
  
`proj_install_deps()`, to reproduce the behavior of your project on another computer:

  - wraps `remotes::install_deps()` to install the project's package dependencies

`proj_use_github_action()`, to run your project using GitHub Actions:

  - wraps `usethis::use_github_action()` to install an Actions template in your project
  - template draws upon [r-lib/actions examples](https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples) to install R, then to install and cache the dependencies
  - **you will need to modify** your project's copy of this template to tell Actions: 
      - what triggers a run 
      - how to build your project
      - how to deploy your project
 
## Installation

You can install the GitHub version of projthis with:

```r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("ijlyttle/projthis")
```

## Acknowledgments

There is precious little original to this package, which is a good thing.
This package rests heavily on the foundation laid by the [**usethis**](https://usethis.r-lib.org/) package, and also relies on [**renv**](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/), [**desc**](https://github.com/r-lib/desc), [**remotes**](https://remotes.r-lib.org/), and [**actions**](https://github.com/r-lib/actions).
